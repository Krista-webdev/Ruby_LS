# Keep score of the player's and computer's wins. When either the player or computer reaches five wins, the match is over, and the winning player becomes the grand winner. Don't add your incrementing logic to display_results. Keep your methods simple; they should perform one logical task â€” no more, no less. think about eliminating repetitive code from the winning combinations method by DRYing your code. Write the "natural" version of the method using a bunch of conditions, then identify the repetitive code in that method. Once you have it, write a method that you can call with different arguments.
