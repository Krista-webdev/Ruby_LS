Write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Casual Pseudo-Code:

1. A method that returns the sum of two integers

Define a method name that accepts two parameters (number1, number2)
Add the first and second integer and store in a variable called result
Return result to the user
Call the method passing it two intergers as arguments

2. A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

Make an array of strings
Define a method that iterates through each string and concatenates them together
Return the concatenated string


3. A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

Make an array of integers
Define a method that will iterate over each integer
and for every other integer, returns a new array

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Formal Pseudo-Code:

1. START

DEFINE a method called sum that accepts (num1, num2)
that adds both number1 and number2
SET the answer to a variable called result
PRINT result

CALL the method passing in two integers as arguments
END

2. 
START

SET array_string = ["string", "string", "string"]
SET iterator = 1

DEFINE a method that takes one parameter (string)
	FOR each string in the array
	splice each string to be added to one string???
PRINT new_string or new_array?


END

3. 
START

SET array_num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
DEFINE a method that iterates over each ingeger in the array
SKIP every other integer
SET every other integer to a new_array
PRINT each new_array

END
